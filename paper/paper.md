# Summary
 Systems where two or more fluids exist in discrete phases
are ubiquitous in nature and in many manufacturing processes. The
common surface (or interface) between two fluids that do not mix
exists in a state of tension, an intrinsic property known as
interfacial tension. Another fundamental property of interest when the
interface between two fluids is also in contact with a surface (for
example a water drop resting on a leaf) is the contact angle, which
describes how liquids spread on a surface â€“ vital information for
dynamic liquid-solid processes such as coating and painting.

Accurate measurements of interfacial tension allow researchers in
industry and academia to make deductions regarding the chemical
composition and crucially, the behavior of the interfaces, enabling
optimal design of devices and processes. In many real formulations or
applied systems, this basic but critical parameter can be quite
challenging to accurately measure. In addition, precise measurements
of the contact angle between a fluid-fluid interface and a solid
surface are critical in order to deduce wetting and spreading
characteristics of liquids on surfaces, important when considering, to
name two examples, the application of paints to surfaces and
pesticides to plants. It is therefore clear that accurate, rapid and
reproducible measurements of interfacial tension and solid contact
angle are imperative for effective design, implementation and
optimization of processes involving multiphase systems.

Here we present the latest version of the open-source software package OpenDrop, first released in 2015 [@Berry2017]. The previous version is in use in many research groups around the world, and is also used in teaching laboratories including Monash University.
The new version, Barracuda, is able to
measure interfacial tension and also contact angle in a variety of
configurations with field-leading accuracy and reproducibility. The contact angle measurement capability is new for this release, but has been used successfully in previous studies [@Prathapan2017].

The
availability of the software allows the interested user to
effectively implement, explore and further develop the techniques for
both research and teaching at a small fraction of the cost of
commercial options. 

<!-- Consequently, OpenDrop will make significant impact
in both research and education by providing inexpensive access to
high-fidelity information on the stability, function, and behaviour of
interfaces, via a simple and user-friendly interface, with open-source
software that will enable users to implement their own functionality. -->
