**OpenDrop** is a fully-featured pendant drop tensiometry software, allowing acquisition, analysis and fitting of pendant drop profiles to obtain surface and interfacial tension. OpenDrop also includes functionality for measuring sessile drop contact angles.

It runs on **Python 3.5+**, and uses **GTK+ 3** for the user interface, and **OpenCV** for image analysis.

OpenDrop is released under the **GNU GPL** open source license, and available for free.
