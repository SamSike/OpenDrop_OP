# OpenDrop-ML

OpenDrop-ML is an open-source, cross-platform tool for analyzing liquid droplets in surface science using contact angle and pendant drop methods. It integrates classical geometric fitting with machine learning models (via Conan-ML), providing flexible, automated, and high-throughput image processing for researchers, technicians, and developers.

Current ML implementation is optimized for high angle systems. For lower angle or extreme curvature drops, verification of results is strongly advised. See: [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c01050](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c01050)

# Quick Start Guide for Windows and Linux

## 1. Install Python

Check if Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

If not, download and install [Python 3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).

## 2. Install C/C++ Build Tools

* **Windows**: Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with Windows 10/11 SDK.
* **Linux**:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential   # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"  # Fedora
```

## 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements-3810.txt
```

## 4. Build Cython Extensions

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## 5. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

## 6. Build Sundials Library (macOS only)

```bash
cd dependencies/macos_x86_64   # or macos_arm64

git clone https://github.com/LLNL/sundials.git
cd sundials
mkdir build && cd build

cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
  -DSUNDIALS_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../sundials

make -j4
make install
```

Ensure the `.a` static libraries are present.

## Troubleshooting

* Confirm Python version is correct
* Cython installed: `pip install cython`
* C++ compiler correctly installed

# Quick Start Guide for macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)

## 1. Install Python

Check if Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

If not, install [Python 3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).

## 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Intel & Apple Silicon)

### Install Conda or Pyenv

* **Apple Silicon**: Install [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
* **Intel Mac**: Conda optional — can use system Python or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

### Create Environment

**Apple Silicon (Must use Conda)**

```bash
conda create -n opendrop_env python=3.8.10 numpy=1.22.4 scipy=1.7.3 pip -c conda-forge
conda activate opendrop_env
pip install tensorflow-macos==2.13.0
pip install -r requirements-3810-macos.txt
```

**Intel Mac (Prefer Python, Conda optional)**

```bash
python3 -m venv opendrop_env
source opendrop_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-3810.txt
```

## 3. Build SUNDIALS Library (macOS only) 
If you are on macOS, SUNDIALS static libraries must be available in:

dependencies/macos_x86_64/sundials/lib/   # for Intel Mac  
dependencies/macos_arm64/sundials/lib/   # for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

They're on a different architecture (e.g., you're Intel, they're Apple Silicon),
Or if .a files are missing or broken,
Then they must recompile using CMake.

### ✅ You can skip this step if:

The correct .a static libraries already exist for your architecture
Files like the following are present:
libsundials_arkode.a
libsundials_nvecserial.a
libsundials_core.a

### ⚠️ You must build manually with CMake if:

You're on a different architecture than the one the libraries were built for
The .a files are missing or broken

```bash
cd dependencies/macos_x86_64   # or macos_arm64

rm -rf sundials   # delete existing repo if present

git clone https://github.com/LLNL/sundials.git
cd sundials
mkdir build && cd build

cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
  -DSUNDIALS_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../sundials

make -j4
make install
```

Ensure `.a` files are built in:

* `macos_x86_64/sundials/lib/`
* or `macos_arm64/sundials/lib/`

## 4. Build Cython Extensions

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/OpenDrop_OP 
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

## 5. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting: Architecture Mismatch (macOS)

If you see:

```
ImportError: ... incompatible architecture (have 'arm64', need 'x86_64h' or 'x86_64')
```

or:

```
ImportError: ... incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64e' or 'arm64')
```

This means `.so` files were built under the wrong architecture.

### ✅ Fix Steps

```bash
python setup.py clean --all
rm -rf build modules/ift/**/**/*.so
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python main.py
```

💡 **Tip**: Always recompile if switching between Intel and Apple Silicon.


If you encounter errors, verify:

* Python version
* Cython is installed: `pip install cython`
* C++ compiler is correctly installed

# Appropriate use of ML model in Contact Angle Analysis

ML predictions should be verified in cases involving:

# Appropriate use of ML model in Contact Angle Analysis

The key limitation of ML models is that accuracy may deteriorate when used
on systems which was not represented within it's training data. While it has
been shown that the model can be applied to systems of contact angles below
110°, caution should be applied applied in these cases. It is recommended that
contact angles are plotted and briefly examined (i.e. sense-checked) as
general practice, but particularly for systems outside of training domain.
Similarly, drops with Bond numbers greater than 2 were not included in the
training set and should be approached with caution.

Surface roughness and reflection were included to train the model to ignore
inputted data which is not the drop edge. However, few images with surface
roughness which deviated from the training data were included in the
experimental data set. As such users are again advised to check outputs
for systems outside of the training range.

As the resolution of an image can be altered, should the resolution of an
image be too high it will be lowered to give an input suitable for the
ML model. This is the only exception to the above limitations.

High quality edge detection should be used to achieve the best results.
This work presents an automated process, which still requires improvement,
but will likely be suitable for high contrast images. Users are recommended
to check that the detected edge is reasonable prior to accepting the results
outputted by any fitting or angle prediction approach.

Current OpenDrop-ML implementation performs best for contact angles above 110°. For low-angle or high-curvature drops, verification is advised. See: [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c01050](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c01050)

Users should validate predictions manually in cases:
* With extreme Bond numbers (>2)
* With strong surface roughness/reflections
* Outside of the model's trained contact angle range
